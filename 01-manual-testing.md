# Manual Testing 🕵️

## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing is the fundamental process of testing software applications by human testers without using automation tools. Testers execute test cases manually by interacting with the application's user interface, APIs, and backend systems to identify bugs, usability issues, performance bottlenecks, and verify functionality meets business requirements.

Manual testing forms the backbone of quality assurance, providing human intuition, exploratory capabilities, and user experience validation that automated tools cannot replicate. It's particularly valuable for usability testing, ad-hoc testing, and scenarios requiring human judgment and creativity.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Manual Testing

#### Functional Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Manual verification of individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Testing component interactions and data flow
- **System Testing**: End-to-end testing of complete application
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Final validation by end users
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality verification after builds
- **Sanity Testing**: Focused testing of specific functionality after changes

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Usability Testing**: User experience and interface evaluation
- **Performance Testing**: Manual performance observation and validation
- **Security Testing**: Manual security vulnerability assessment
- **Compatibility Testing**: Cross-browser, cross-platform validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Manual accessibility compliance verification

#### Specialized Testing Types
- **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing without predefined scripts
- **Monkey Testing**: Random input testing to find unexpected issues
- **Negative Testing**: Testing with invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Boundary Value Testing**: Testing at the edges of input domains
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Testing representative values from input classes

### Testing Techniques

#### Black Box Testing
Testing without knowledge of internal code structure, focusing on input-output behavior.

```
Example Test Case:
Title: Login with valid credentials
Precondition: User has valid account (username: testuser@example.com, password: Test123!)
Steps:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid username
3. Enter valid password
4. Click login button
Expected Result: User successfully logged in and redirected to dashboard
Actual Result: [To be filled during execution]
Status: [Pass/Fail]
```

#### White Box Testing
Testing with complete knowledge of internal implementation, focusing on code coverage and logic paths.

#### Gray Box Testing
Combination approach using both black box and white box techniques.
